# Nightmare Freddy
#### What does the mod add?
- Nightmare Freddy as an new entity
- Nightmare Freddy's Freddles as a new entity
#### So, how does it work?
##### Freddles
Nightmare Freddy will bring a new mechanic to the game which will disrupt the work of your ship mommy! Freddles will start invading the ship and they must be stopped! Once 6 Freddles have sat down in the ship, Nightmare Freddy will spawn and it will be to late!
To defeat the Freddles, you have 2 options, 
- Look at them before they reach the ship long enough for them to Die,
- Use a Flashlight and burn them ( Only work once they have settled down on your ship )

The Freddles that are present when Freddy spawn will become aggressive, so always get rid of them when you can.
##### Freddy
When Freddy spawn, you will hear his usual lullaby. From then on, any Freddle you touch will damage you and will despawn the Freddle.
Freddy is slow, and will always target the player closest from himself and the ship ( The 2 values are added together )
###### Once Freddy Spawns, there is no going back, so make sure it doesn't happen

#### Is this mod Fully released?
NO, this mod is in it's BETA phase, please communicate with me either on Github or Discord for any problems you may face.
#### Can I play this mod solo?
I would not suggest playing this mod solo for it was designed for crew that leaves a player on the ship. I will be creating a lightweight version of this mod which will make Freddy spawn inside in the near future!
#### Where are the configs?
There are no configs right now, but the file is at the same place as usual... Just empty...
#### Did you give up on Freddy Krueger?
No, I just didn't feel like working on him! Rest assured, I have not given up on Freddy
#### Piece of Medias I created are present in this mod! I claim ownership!
Please communicate with me through Discord or Github, I'll answer any worries. Do note I do not make any money from mod creation!
